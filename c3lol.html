        <p> C3 has been representing USC and the greater Los Angeles area with its thriving talent and relentless efforts. Competing in numerous competitions in Socal, C3 has established a reputation amongst other school hiphop dance teams. Especially the past two semesters, C3 has placed close to the top3 in several competitions and even won Urban Street Jam. They have recently performed a set based in racecars. Just as how car racing is arguable the most fast paced and dramatic sport there is, C3's performance was excpetional and fantastic. </p>
